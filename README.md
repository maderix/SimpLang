# SimpLang: A Domain-Specific Language for SIMD Optimization

SimpLang is a domain-specific language (DSL) designed to facilitate SIMD hardware optimization, particularly for deep learning applications. It provides high-level abstractions for SIMD operations, coupled with robust debugging and runtime infrastructure.

## Getting Started

### Quick Start with Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is using our development helper script:

```bash
# One-time setup (builds container and compiles project)
./dev.sh setup

# Daily development workflow
./dev.sh build           # Rebuild after code changes
./dev.sh test            # Run all tests
./dev.sh debug           # Start interactive debugger
./dev.sh shell           # Open development shell

# Additional commands
./dev.sh clean           # Clean build artifacts
./dev.sh rebuild         # Clean and rebuild everything
```

**Benefits of this approach:**
- ✅ **No rebuilds needed** - Files are live-mounted via Docker volumes
- ✅ **Instant compilation** - Create new `.sl` files and compile immediately
- ✅ **Persistent build cache** - Incremental builds are fast
- ✅ **Easy debugging** - Interactive debugger with live source files

**Legacy Docker commands (still work):**
```bash
# Build and run tests manually
docker build -t simplang . && docker run --rm simplang

# Run individual tests
docker run --rm simplang ./build/tests/test_arithmetic_runner ./build/tests/obj/test_arithmetic.so
```

### Development with VS Code Dev Container

For the best development experience with full IDE support:

1. **Install VS Code extensions:**
   - Dev Containers extension
   - C/C++ extension pack

2. **Open in container:**
   ```bash
   # Clone and open
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd simple-lang
   code .
   # Click "Reopen in Container" when prompted
   ```

3. **Build and test inside container:**
   ```bash
   ./build.sh
   ./run_tests.sh
   ```

### Local Installation (Manual Setup)

If you prefer local development, install these prerequisites:

- LLVM 14 or later
- CMake 3.20+
- C++17 compatible compiler
- Boost libraries
- readline library

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y \
    llvm-14-dev \
    clang-14 \
    cmake \
    libboost-dev \
    libreadline-dev
```

### Building SimpLang

You have two options for building:

1. **Using build script (recommended)**
```bash
./build.sh
```

2. **Manual CMake build**
```bash
# Configure with SIMD debugging enabled
cmake -B build -DSIMD_DEBUG=ON

# Build the compiler
cmake --build build --target simplang
```

### Running Tests

Execute the test suite using:
```bash
./run_tests.sh
```

### Using SimpLang

1. **Compile a SimpLang Kernel**
```bash
# Syntax: ./build/src/simplang <input_file.sl>
./build/src/simplang my_kernel.sl
```

2. **Run a Compiled Kernel**
```bash
# Syntax: ./build/tests/test_loop_runner <path_to_compiled_kernel.so>
./build/tests/test_loop_runner ./build/tests/obj/test_loop.so
```

### Example Workflow

1. Create a SimpLang kernel (`test_loop.sl`):
```simplang
fn kernel_main() {
    var sum = 0.0;
    var i = 1.0;
    
    while (i <= 100.0) {
        sum = sum + i;
        i = i + 1.0;
    }
    return sum;
}
```

2. Compile the kernel:
```bash
./build/src/simplang test_loop.sl
```

3. Run the compiled kernel:
```bash
./build/tests/test_loop_runner ./build/tests/obj/test_loop.so
```

### Development Tips

- Enable SIMD debugging for detailed vector operation insights:
```bash
cmake -B build -DSIMD_DEBUG=ON
```

- Use the test runner for quick iteration:
```bash
# Compile and run in one step
./run_tests.sh
```

### Common Issues

1. **Build Failures**
   - Ensure LLVM 14 is installed and in PATH
   - Check that all dependencies are installed
   - Verify CMake version is 3.20 or higher

2. **Runtime Issues**

## Core Concepts

### Host-Kernel Architecture

SimpLang employs a Host-Kernel architecture. Your main application (the **host**, typically written in C++) interacts with specialized, compiled SimpLang code (the **kernel**) to perform computationally intensive tasks.

**Key Benefits:**

* **Modularity:** Kernels can be changed or updated without recompiling the entire host application.
* **Specialization:**  Kernels are optimized for specific SIMD tasks.
* **Isolation:** Kernel crashes are contained, preventing host application failure.

### Workflow

1. **Write SimpLang Kernel Code:** Define your SIMD-optimized logic within a SimpLang kernel.
2. **Compile Kernel:** The SimpLang compiler transforms your code into a shared library (e.g., `.so` on Linux).
3. **Integrate with Host Program:**  Your C++ host application loads and executes the compiled kernel.

### Safety and Reliability

SimpLang prioritizes safety and reliability through:

* **Robust Error Handling:**  Provides informative error messages for easier debugging.
* **Automatic Resource Management:** Ensures proper cleanup of memory and other resources.
* **Type Safety:**  Enforces data type consistency between the host and kernel.

## Compiler Pipeline: From Source to Execution

The SimpLang compiler transforms your code through a series of stages:

1. **Lexical Analysis (Text to Tokens):** The source code is broken down into fundamental units called tokens (keywords, identifiers, operators, etc.).

   ```simplang
   fn add(var x, var y) {
       return x + y;
   }
   ```

   **Tokens Example:** `fn`, `add`, `(`, `var`, `x`, `,`, `var`, `y`, `)`, `{`, `return`, `x`, `+`, `y`, `}`,

   This stage identifies syntax errors like misspelled keywords.

2. **Syntactic Analysis (Understanding Structure):** The compiler analyzes the token stream to build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), representing the code's structure and relationships between elements.

   **AST Example (Simplified):**

   ```
   Function: add
     Parameters: x, y
     Body:
       Return Statement:
         Binary Operation: +
           Left Operand: x
           Right Operand: y
   ```

   This stage detects logical errors, such as incorrect operator usage.

3. **Optimization:** The compiler applies various optimizations to improve performance:

   * **Basic Optimizations:** Simplifies expressions, removes redundant operations, and reorders calculations.
   * **SIMD Optimization:** Leverages CPU instructions to perform multiple operations in parallel (e.g., using SSE or AVX).
   * **Memory Optimization:**  Arranges data for efficient access, including data alignment and minimizing unnecessary memory transfers.

4. **Code Generation (Final Output):** The optimized code is translated into a shared library (e.g., `.so`). This library includes:

   * **Executable Code:**  Machine code ready for execution.
   * **Debug Information:**  Facilitates debugging by mapping source code to machine code.

**Development Experience:**

* **Clear Error Messages:**  Provides specific and helpful error messages to pinpoint issues.
* **Warnings:**  Alerts developers to potential problems that might not be immediate errors.
* **Debug Information:** Enables source-level debugging.

**Performance Focus:** The compiler is designed to generate highly efficient code by leveraging modern CPU features, SIMD instructions, and cache-friendly memory layouts.

## Debugging Infrastructure

SimpLang provides a robust debugging infrastructure for inspecting kernel behavior with minimal performance impact when disabled.

**Core Architecture:**

```
Host Program <-> Debug Interface <-> Kernel Runtime
     |               |                    |
     +-> Commands ---+-> Runtime Hooks    |
     |               |                    |
     +-- State   <---+-- Event Queue     |
     |               |                    |
     +-- Control <---+-- Breakpoints     |
```

**Key Features:**

* **Hardware and Software Breakpoints:** Supports setting breakpoints using hardware registers (minimal overhead) or software interrupts.
    * **Zero Overhead (Disabled):** Breakpoint checks have negligible performance impact when not active.
    * **Conditional Breakpoints:**  Break execution based on specific conditions.
    * **Source-Level Mapping:**  Relate breakpoints to specific lines of SimpLang code.
* **Memory Tracking:**  Monitors memory allocation and usage to detect leaks and analyze patterns.
    * **SIMD Alignment Verification:** Ensures data is correctly aligned for SIMD operations.
    * **Vector Operation Tracking:** Monitors memory access during vector operations.
    * **Memory Access Pattern Analysis:** Helps identify inefficient memory access.
* **Call Stack Inspection:** Provides detailed call stack information, including function arguments and local variable states.
    * **SIMD Register Inspection:** Examine the contents of SIMD registers.
    * **Vector Operation Flow:** Track the execution of vector operations.
    * **Memory Access Analysis:**  Analyze memory access patterns within the call stack.
* **Asynchronous Event Processing:**  Handles debugging events efficiently without blocking kernel execution.
    * **Lock-Free Queue:**  Utilizes lock-free data structures for high-throughput event processing.
    * **Configurable Buffering:**  Allows customization of event buffering strategies.
    * **Real-time Filtering:**  Filter specific debugging events.

**Integration Example (C++ Host):**

```cpp
// Attach debugger with custom configuration
DebugConfig config;
config.enableMemoryTracking()
     .setBreakpointMode(HardwareBreakpoints)
     .setEventBuffering(1024);

runner.attachDebugger(config);

// Register custom event handlers
runner.debugger().onMemoryLeak([](const LeakInfo& info) {
    std::cout << "Leak detected: " << info.size << " bytes\n";
});
```

**Performance Characteristics (Approximate):**

* **Breakpoints (inactive):** Near zero overhead.
* **Memory Tracking:** 2-5% overhead.
* **Call Stack Inspection:** 1-3% overhead.
* **Event System:** <1% overhead with buffering.

#include "kernel_runner.hpp"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    try {
        KernelRunner runner;
        runner.loadLibrary("./kernel.so"); // Assuming kernel.so is the compiled output

        // Optional: Enable debugging
        // runner.attachDebugger();

        // Run kernel and get result
        double result = runner.runKernel();

        std::cout << "Result: " << result << std::endl;
        return 0;
    } catch (const std::exception& e) {
        std::cerr << "Error: " << e.what() << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }
}
```

Okay, here's a significantly reorganized and cleaned-up version of the SimpleLang documentation, aiming for better clarity, conciseness, and logical flow.

## SimpleLang: A Domain-Specific Language for SIMD Optimization

SimpleLang is a domain-specific language (DSL) designed to facilitate SIMD hardware optimization, particularly for deep learning applications. It provides high-level abstractions for SIMD operations, coupled with robust debugging and runtime infrastructure.

## Core Concepts

### Host-Kernel Architecture

SimpleLang employs a Host-Kernel architecture. Your main application (the **host**, typically written in C++) interacts with specialized, compiled SimpleLang code (the **kernel**) to perform computationally intensive tasks.

**Key Benefits:**

* **Modularity:** Kernels can be changed or updated without recompiling the entire host application.
* **Specialization:**  Kernels are optimized for specific SIMD tasks.
* **Isolation:** Kernel crashes are contained, preventing host application failure.

### Workflow

1. **Write SimpleLang Kernel Code:** Define your SIMD-optimized logic within a SimpleLang kernel.
2. **Compile Kernel:** The SimpleLang compiler transforms your code into a shared library (e.g., `.so` on Linux).
3. **Integrate with Host Program:**  Your C++ host application loads and executes the compiled kernel.

### Safety and Reliability

SimpleLang prioritizes safety and reliability through:

* **Robust Error Handling:**  Provides informative error messages for easier debugging.
* **Automatic Resource Management:** Ensures proper cleanup of memory and other resources.
* **Type Safety:**  Enforces data type consistency between the host and kernel.

## Compiler Pipeline: From Source to Execution

The SimpleLang compiler transforms your code through a series of stages:

1. **Lexical Analysis (Text to Tokens):** The source code is broken down into fundamental units called tokens (keywords, identifiers, operators, etc.).

   ```simplang
   fn add(var x, var y) {
       return x + y;
   }
   ```

   **Tokens Example:** `fn`, `add`, `(`, `var`, `x`, `,`, `var`, `y`, `)`, `{`, `return`, `x`, `+`, `y`, `}`,

   This stage identifies syntax errors like misspelled keywords.

2. **Syntactic Analysis (Understanding Structure):** The compiler analyzes the token stream to build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), representing the code's structure and relationships between elements.

   **AST Example (Simplified):**

   ```
   Function: add
     Parameters: x, y
     Body:
       Return Statement:
         Binary Operation: +
           Left Operand: x
           Right Operand: y
   ```

   This stage detects logical errors, such as incorrect operator usage.

3. **Optimization:** The compiler applies various optimizations to improve performance:

   * **Basic Optimizations:** Simplifies expressions, removes redundant operations, and reorders calculations.
   * **SIMD Optimization:** Leverages CPU instructions to perform multiple operations in parallel (e.g., using SSE or AVX).
   * **Memory Optimization:**  Arranges data for efficient access, including data alignment and minimizing unnecessary memory transfers.

4. **Code Generation (Final Output):** The optimized code is translated into a shared library (e.g., `.so`). This library includes:

   * **Executable Code:**  Machine code ready for execution.
   * **Debug Information:**  Facilitates debugging by mapping source code to machine code.

**Development Experience:**

* **Clear Error Messages:**  Provides specific and helpful error messages to pinpoint issues.
* **Warnings:**  Alerts developers to potential problems that might not be immediate errors.
* **Debug Information:** Enables source-level debugging.

**Performance Focus:** The compiler is designed to generate highly efficient code by leveraging modern CPU features, SIMD instructions, and cache-friendly memory layouts.

## Debugging Infrastructure

SimpleLang provides a robust debugging infrastructure for inspecting kernel behavior with minimal performance impact when disabled.

**Core Architecture:**

```
Host Program <-> Debug Interface <-> Kernel Runtime
     |               |                    |
     +-> Commands ---+-> Runtime Hooks    |
     |               |                    |
     +-- State   <---+-- Event Queue     |
     |               |                    |
     +-- Control <---+-- Breakpoints     |
```

**Key Features:**

* **Hardware and Software Breakpoints:** Supports setting breakpoints using hardware registers (minimal overhead) or software interrupts.
    * **Zero Overhead (Disabled):** Breakpoint checks have negligible performance impact when not active.
    * **Conditional Breakpoints:**  Break execution based on specific conditions.
    * **Source-Level Mapping:**  Relate breakpoints to specific lines of SimpleLang code.
* **Memory Tracking:**  Monitors memory allocation and usage to detect leaks and analyze patterns.
    * **SIMD Alignment Verification:** Ensures data is correctly aligned for SIMD operations.
    * **Vector Operation Tracking:** Monitors memory access during vector operations.
    * **Memory Access Pattern Analysis:** Helps identify inefficient memory access.
* **Call Stack Inspection:** Provides detailed call stack information, including function arguments and local variable states.
    * **SIMD Register Inspection:** Examine the contents of SIMD registers.
    * **Vector Operation Flow:** Track the execution of vector operations.
    * **Memory Access Analysis:**  Analyze memory access patterns within the call stack.
* **Asynchronous Event Processing:**  Handles debugging events efficiently without blocking kernel execution.
    * **Lock-Free Queue:**  Utilizes lock-free data structures for high-throughput event processing.
    * **Configurable Buffering:**  Allows customization of event buffering strategies.
    * **Real-time Filtering:**  Filter specific debugging events.

**Integration Example (C++ Host):**

```cpp
// Attach debugger with custom configuration
DebugConfig config;
config.enableMemoryTracking()
     .setBreakpointMode(HardwareBreakpoints)
     .setEventBuffering(1024);

runner.attachDebugger(config);

// Register custom event handlers
runner.debugger().onMemoryLeak([](const LeakInfo& info) {
    std::cout << "Leak detected: " << info.size << " bytes\n";
});
```

**Performance Characteristics (Approximate):**

* **Breakpoints (inactive):** Near zero overhead.
* **Memory Tracking:** 2-5% overhead.
* **Call Stack Inspection:** 1-3% overhead.
* **Event System:** <1% overhead with buffering.

## Core Language Features

## Implementation Example

### SimpleLang Kernel (`kernel.sl`)

```simplang
fn bounded_sum(var n) {
    var sum = 0.0;
    var i = 1.0;

    while (i <= n) {
        sum = (sum + i) % 10000.0;
        i = i + 1.0;
    }
    return sum;
}

fn kernel_main() {
    var n = 100000.0;
    return bounded_sum(n);
}
```

### Host Program Integration (C++)

```cpp
#include "kernel_runner.hpp"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    try {
        KernelRunner runner;
        runner.loadLibrary("./kernel.so"); // Assuming kernel.so is the compiled output

        // Optional: Enable debugging
        // runner.attachDebugger();

        // Run kernel and get result
        double result = runner.runKernel();

        std::cout << "Result: " << result << std::endl;
        return 0;
    } catch (const std::exception& e) {
        std::cerr << "Error: " << e.what() << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }
}
```

## Performance Characteristics (Typical)

* **JIT Compilation Overhead:** < 1 millisecond.
* **SIMD Operation Performance:** Approximately 1.3x slower than highly optimized native C++ (trade-off for abstraction and ease of use).
* **Memory Overhead:**  Around 2MB per kernel instance.
* **Debug Mode Overhead:**  Approximately 5% in typical usage scenarios.

## Development Workflow

1. **Write SimpleLang Kernel Code:** Create your SIMD-optimized logic in `.sl` files.
2. **Compile Kernel:** Use the SimpleLang compiler to generate a shared library (e.g., `kernel.so`).
3. **Integrate with Host Program:** Load and interact with the compiled kernel from your C++ application using the provided `KernelRunner` API.
4. **Debug:** Utilize the built-in debugging infrastructure to step through code, inspect variables, and analyze performance.
5. **Profile and Optimize:**  Identify performance bottlenecks and refine your SimpleLang code or compiler settings.
